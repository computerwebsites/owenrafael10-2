			<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="text">This Website is about the class of 10-2 St. Benedict of Nursia s.y 2018-2019. A class that treats each other as a family and not as a friend.Every person in this class have a different dreams. We are very inspired to reaching our dreams because we have Mr. Jerome Olais Nimer as our class adviser who always motivates us to keep striving hard.</p>
			<p  class="text">I made this website in order for me to not forget this class. This class so very fun and memorable, But sadly the end of school year is near. But it's okay because we will not forget each other. Destiny could separate us but these memories will never turn into dust. That is the value of a true family.</p>
